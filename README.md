# groupoid-rl

## Introduction

Properties of the underlying group has been used to train RL to partially solve a rubik's cube [1].
We believe that we can generalize this result from groups to groupoids. 

## Groupoids

Groupoids have an algebraic and a category theory definition. We focus on the algebraic definition for this article.
